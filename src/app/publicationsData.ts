            title: '3DUI and the Phantom Limb: multisensory experience for embodiment of amputation',
            venue: 'VR 2020',
            authors: 'CALEPSO, A., GUARESE, R. L. M., VALER, R., IQUIAPAZA, Y., de JESUS OLIVEIRA, V. A., NEDEL, L. and MACIEL, A.',
            abstract: 'In the context of the 3DUI Contest promoted by the IEEE VR 2020, we propose an application to allow users to experience having an amputated arm. By providing both visual and haptic feedback, our application offers a multisensory experience to enhance the sense of embodiment. The user of our application should still feel their real limb attached to their bodies, and yet see their virtual avatar and interact with the virtual environment as an amputee. A simple task of handling and positioning objects in a table is proposed for the users to experience the difficulties of having a missing arm. As most amputees have the sensation that an amputated or missing limb is still attached, our application should allow users to experience the same feeling.',

            title: 'A Usability Assessment of Augmented Situated Visualization',
            venue: 'VR 2020',
            authors: 'GUARESE, R. L. M., BECKER, J., FENSTERSEIFER, H., CALEPSO, A., WALTER, M., FREITAS, C., NEDEL, L. and MACIEL, A.',
            abstract: 'The present work proposes the use of data visualization techniques allied to an Augmented Reality (AR) user interface to provide information for users to define the most convenient location to sit down at an event. This accounts for different sets of arbitrary demands by projecting 3D information directly atop the seats. The users can also rearrange the data to narrow down the search and switch the attribute being displayed, e.g. temperature, stage visibility, exit access or Wi-Fi signal. The proposed approach was tested against a comparable 2D interactive visualization of the same data. Each user performed twelve location choosing tasks in an average sized classroom. Qualitative and quantitative data indicated that the augmented solution is promising in some senses, exposing that AR may help users to make better decisions.',

            authors: 'VALER, R., SCHRAMM, R. and NEDEL, L.',
            abstract: 'The 21st centuryâ€™s economic growth and social transformation are hardly based on creativity. To help with the development of this skill, the Creativity Support Tools (CST) concept was proposed. Here, we introduce Musical Brush, an artistic-based CST mobile application for music and drawing improvisation. We investigated different types of interaction designs and audiovisual feedbacks, measuring their impact on creativity support. A user study with 26 subjects was conducted to verify the Creativity Support Index (CSI) score of each design. Results showed the suitability of the association of Musical Brush with Augmented Reality (AR) for creating new sounds and drawings.',
